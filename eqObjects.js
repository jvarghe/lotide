/* CHALLENGE
 * 
 * While working more with objects recently, we've created functions that 
 * return objects. When writing out assertions to test the return value of 
 * these functions, we quickly realized that our assertEqual can't be used 
 * directly. assertEqual can really only be used for checking primitive return 
 * types.
 * 
 * You may also recall that we had run into a similar problem with comparing 
 * array data. To solve this we implemented `eqArrays()` and then subsequently 
 * implemented `assertArraysEqual()` into our Lotide project. It's time to do 
 * the same for objects now, starting with `eqObjects()`. This function 
 * implementation will require us to further practice problem solving through 
 * object key iteration again. Fun times!
 * 
 * Implement the definition for function `eqObjects()` which will take in two 
 * objects and returns `true` or `false`, based on a perfect match.

// This function takes two objects and compares all their keys to see if they
// are equal. Based on the result, it returns a boolean value.

  // Create `areObjectsEqual`. Don't set a value; the value will must be 
  // determined by the results of comparison.
  let areObjectsEqual;


  // Compare the length of the objects, which will quickly tell us if the two
  // objects have the same number of keys. As objects don't have a .`length` 
  // property, convert them into arrays. This will result in an array of their 
  // keys being created. Compare the lengths of the two arrays:
  const object1Array = Object.keys(object1);
  const object2Array = Object.keys(object2);

  if (object1Array.length !== object2Array.length) {
    return areObjectsEqual = false;

  // the values of the keys to see if they are the same

        // `areObjectsEqual` to `true`, and move on to the next key.

        // NOT equal. Set `areObjectsEqual` to `false`, return this value and
