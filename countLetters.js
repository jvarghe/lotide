/* CHALLENGE: In this activity, we will create another Lotide function. This 
 * one will be like the `countOnly()` function from the previous activity. The 
 * function should take in a sentence (as a string) and then return a count of 
 * each of the letters in that sentence. For example, countLetters('LHL') 
 * should return results indicating that L appears twice, and H once. 
 * 
 * Do NOT provide a count of letters that did not show up in the string. Skip
 * and do NOT count spaces.
